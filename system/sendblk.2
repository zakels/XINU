NAME
	
	sendblk

SYNOPSIS
	
	#include <xinu.h>
	
	syscall sendblk(pid32 pid, umsg32 msg);

DESCRIPTION
	
	The sendblk system call is used to send a message to recipient process. It
	functions like normal send() system call when the message buffer is empty.
	When the message buffer is full, sendblk blocks sending by putting into a
	waiting state PR_SNDBLK. When the sending process gets blocked, it saves
	the msg and the recipient pid to the members of its structure, sendblkmsg
	and sendblkrcp. And the sending process gets enqueue'd into FIFO waiting
	queue in the recipient sendqueue.
	
RETURN VALUE

	On failure, it returns SYSERR. Otherwise, it returns OK .

ERRORS

	sendblk() fails when the recipient pid is invalid pid. Or the recipient
	process is unused. Both failtures returns SYSERR.

EXAMPLE

	The program below demonstrates the use of XINU's sendblk().

	#include <xinu.h>

	process sender(pid) {
		umsg32 msg = 0x13;
		sendblk(pid , msg);
		return OK;
	}
