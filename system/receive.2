NAME
	
	receive

SYNOPSIS
	
	#include <xinu.h>
	
	umsg32 receive(void);

DESCRIPTION
	
	The receive system call is used to receive messages from the sender processes'
	or from the sender message queue. If the message buffer is not empty, it checks
	the queue to see if there exists sender processes. If there is, it dequeues the 
	first sender process and place the next receive message to be the one in the 
	message buffer of the first sender process in the queue.
	
RETURN VALUE

	It returns the message, type of umsg32, to the caller process.

ERRORS

	receive() fails when there is no message in the recipient message buffer. If 
	receive() fails, the process gets rescheduled and blocked until a message 
	arrives.

EXAMPLE

	The program below demonstrates the use of XINU's receive().

	#include <xinu.h>

	process receiver() {
		umsg32 msg;
		while (TRUE) {
			sleep(5);
			msg = receive();
		}
	}
